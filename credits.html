  <h1>Editor's Note:</h1>
    <p>As of 2021, Dust1947 / DustGame (Paolo Parente's company) and the US Distributor DustUSA are both defunct. In July 2022, the former owner of DustUSA (GregB) notified the community that scammers had taken over the DustUSA site. See his message below:</p>
    <img class="fullsizeimg" alt="Hi Everyone! Some of you have noticed and wrote us about the reopening of the DUSTUSA.NET website. It's a SCAM. Dust USA is defunct and the website too. There is no reopening by Dust USA LLC in any way, shape or form and Alicia and I are not part of Dust in any way shape or form. Don't go on that website, the links all lead to a gambling/betting scam stuff." src="images/dustusa-defunct-notice.png"/>
    <p>As such, links to these sites have been removed from this credit page or redirected to archival pages.</p>
